    "\n",
    "The risk of this categorization flow is that we do not have a method to test if the way we are separating these categories is the correct one. For example, we can have a ticket with the following parameters:\n",
    "* Price = \\$199\n",
    "* One transfer\n",
    "* Refund available\n",
    "* Luggage included\n",
    "\n",
    "This ticket would be in the \"Best offer\" category. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can also have a ticket with these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Price = \\$200\n",
    "* Zero transfers\n",
    "* Refund available\n",
    "* Luggage included\n",
    "\n",
    "And this ticket would be in the \"Normal offer\" category. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is clear that the second offer is way better than the first one. Having zero transfers in the second transfer clearly outweights the \\$1 difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can see in this categorization flow that tickets with price between `250` and `300`, with transfers greater than or equal to `3` and with no refund policy should also be placed in the \"Bad offer\" category rather than in the \"Other category\". These are worse offers than the ones already in the \"Bad offers\", so they should be also included in the \"Bad offers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it should be beneficious to use a **decision tree** to find the best categories for these tickets."
